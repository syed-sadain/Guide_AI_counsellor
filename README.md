## 📌 Overview

**AI Counsellor Abroad** is an AI-powered study-abroad counselling platform designed to help students make **confident, personalized, and data-driven decisions** about studying overseas.

The platform combines **AI-powered profile analysis, university shortlisting, application planning, and conversational guidance** into a single modern interface.

Instead of simply providing a list of universities, the application understands the student's profile and helps organize universities into:

* 🟢 **Dream Universities**
* 🟡 **Target Universities**
* 🔵 **Safe Universities**

Students can then **lock their preferred universities** and manage the next steps required for their applications.

> Built as a solution for the **Humanity Founders Hackathon**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students planning to study abroad often struggle with:

* Choosing universities suitable for their academic profile.
* Understanding admission requirements.
* Comparing multiple universities.
* Evaluating their chances realistically.
* Organizing application tasks.

* Knowing which universities should be considered Dream, Target, or Safe options.

Traditional counselling can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to scale.

**AI Counsellor Abroad** provides an intelligent and empathetic digital counsellor that analyzes a student's profile and assists throughout the university-selection and application-planning journey.

## 🤖 AI Counselling Capabilities

The AI counsellor can be extended to support questions such as:

```text
"Which universities match my profile?"

"What are my safer university options?"

"Which countries fit my budget?"

"What documents do I need?"

"Which university should I prioritize?"

"What should I complete before the application deadline?"
```

The AI layer can use the student's stored profile and application context to provide more relevant guidance.

---

## 🎓 University Recommendation Strategy

The recommendation system is designed around three categories:

### 🟢 Dream

Highly competitive universities where admission may be challenging but potentially achievable.

### 🟡 Target

Universities where the student's academic and profile characteristics provide a more realistic opportunity.

### 🔵 Safe

Universities where the student's profile is comparatively stronger against typical admission requirements.

> These categories are intended as guidance and should not be interpreted as guaranteed admission predictions.
